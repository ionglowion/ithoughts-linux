	* ui.c: removed about tab, will try to make something better for a6.

2001-03-23 Anthony Taranto <voltronw@yahoo.com>

	* ui.c: had to take show_row() out from within the freeze/thaw pair to
	allow show_row() to show the last row if need be. this introduces some
	flicker in certain instances.

2001-03-22 Anthony Taranto <voltronw@yahoo.com>

	* entry.c: doesn't call populate() unless necessary in a few places.
	* ui.c: keeps the selected row in the entries clist visible.
	* ui.c: added about tab. it is somewhat sparse.

2001-03-21 Anthony Taranto <voltronw@yahoo.com>

	* ui.c: entry name GtkEntry is now wider. also added some changes to
	the entries clist populate function to keep the selected entry visible.

2001-03-20 Anthony Taranto <voltronw@yahoo.com>

	* entries are now shown when they are selected from the clist, not from the
	click event. this allows keyboard control, and the current entry is always
	apparent by looking at the clist selection.
	* file.c: very long entries can now be read. we use a GString to buffer
	successive SAX character callbacks for each field and only put it in the
	Entry when we are done with the xml field.
	* ui.c: fixed a bug where the current entry's text was always sent to the
	action regardless of what the menu popped up on.

	* the actions menu now consists of only the actions selected in the clists
	on the actions tab.

2001-03-18 Joe Bowman <jbowman@kiva.net>

	* actions and modules are now multi-selectable and are selected by default
	* connected the select and unselect signals for 
	ithought_callback_modules_clist to the appropriate callback functions in
	callback.c. Nothing happening there yet though.

2001-03-17 Anthony Taranto <voltronw@yahoo.com>

	* file.c: can now read 1 char fields successfully.
	* ui.c: displays a warning if ithought_ui_entries_clist_populate() doesn't
	show all the entries while the search string is empty.
