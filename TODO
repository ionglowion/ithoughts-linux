- support for editing entries in an external editor.
- command line interface
- better featureset for livejournal client.
- i18n, maybe?
- there is some code that many modules share, this should be put in one file,
	instead of a (possibly) different implementation in each separate file.
- allow plugins to get the entry title as well as the body.
- in ui.c populate(), i had to move show_row() out of the freeze/thaw block to
	allow gtk to show the whole row, this can introduce flicker if the user
	rapidly creates new entries.
